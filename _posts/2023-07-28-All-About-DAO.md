# What is DAO?
In simple words, a DAO is an independent organization managed by the communities. The underlying laws are established via smart contracts that decide the selected course of action to be adopted in the future. The members might at any time openly evaluate DAOâ€™s digital code, cast votes, and give suggestions.
The entire infrastructure of a DAO blockchain platform is solely managed by its members, who collaborate on key project decisions, including technological improvements and treasury allocations.

# How To Create & Run A DAO?
## Steps to Create a DAO:
### 1. Define the structure of the DAO Project
- What do you expect your DAO will achieve? What are your goals?
- Decisions your DAO will make?
- Is your company ready to accept a community-focused decentralized ownership structure?
- Is there a current difficulty in your industry that a DAO could solve?
- Will your community, consumers, and customers benefit from a DAO?
 
### 2. Decide the type of DAO
- Protocol DAOs: A protocol DAO, as the name implies, focuses on governance via decentralized protocols. To deliver DeFi services, several DAOs use smart contract technologies. The most well-known protocol DAOs are MakerDAO, Uniswap, and Yearn Finances.
- Investment DAOs:In investment DAOs, crypto owners come together to support new projects, startups, etc. or make investments in them.
- Social DAOs: Social DAOs are portals supporting social networking within the crypto community. Blockster is a popular social DAO. Such platforms provide digital democracy.
- Collector DAOs: Artists who make art with nonfungible tokens (NFTs) rely on collector DAOs to demonstrate ownership of their work.
- Media DAOs: Media DAOs enable content product owners (i.e., readers) to contribute directly without involving marketers in exchange for the native currency as a reward for their work.
- Entertainment DAOs: Entertainment DAOs provide decentralized entertainment by letting creators bring their idea to life while maintaining control over their administration. 
- Philanthropy DAOs: These DAOs are dedicated to aiding social responsibility projects navigating the Web 3.0 world. The Big Green DAO is the first Philanthropy DAO, and it is a charity organization that strives to raise awareness about growing food.
