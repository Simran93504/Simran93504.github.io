# Working with Git 
- Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository
- Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
- When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
- You select the modified files you want to Stage
- The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files
- Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
- You can revert back to any previous commit.
- Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!
