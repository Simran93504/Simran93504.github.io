I had to make a responsive WPF app in C# . First of all I had to learn C# as it was new programming Language for me . I watched a basic tutorial of C# but i found it quite easy as it much resembles with C++.
Next Step was to learn that how can make WPF app , I would like to give a short tutorial exactly the way I followed in my blog post.
