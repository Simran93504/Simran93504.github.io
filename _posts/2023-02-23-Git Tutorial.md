# What is Git? <br>
Git is a popular version control system. <br>
It is used for:<br>

Tracking code changes <br>
Tracking who made changes <br>
Coding collaboration <br>

## Working with Git 
- Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository
- Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
- When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
- You select the modified files you want to Stage
- The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files
- Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
- You can revert back to any previous commit.
- Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!

# Git Getting Started

## Git Install
You can download Git for free from the following website: https://www.git-scm.com/

## Using Git with Command Line
For Windows, you can use Git bash, which comes included in Git for Windows. For Mac and Linux you can use the built-in terminal.

The first thing we need to do, is to check if Git is properly installed:

``` simran@LAPTOP-N3JFRHHJ MINGW64 ~
$ git --version
git version 2.39.0.windows.2 
```
