# Handwritten Text Recognition System
Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) system implemented with TensorFlow (TF) and trained on the IAM off-line HTR dataset. The model takes images of single words or text lines (multiple words) as input and outputs the recognized text. 3/4 of the words from the validation-set are correctly recognized, and the character error rate is around 10%.
